  <!-- Card 1 -->
  <div class="card active">
    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>I was born into a simple, hardworking family. We weren't poor, but life required planning. My parents balanced every need with care, ensuring we had food, education, and values. Laughter echoed in our home, but so did the sound of ambition. They taught me to dream with my feet on the ground.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Card 2 -->
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Discovering My Drive</h2>
    <p>Even as a child, I was curious‚Äîalways asking "why" and tinkering with anything I could take apart and rebuild. My love for learning grew when I started school. I remember getting excited about books and how they could take me to other worlds. Education quickly became my escape and my identity.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Card 3 -->
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Lessons Through Responsibility</h2>
    <p>At home, I helped with chores and errands. Sometimes I joined my dad at his workshop, learning not just tools but patience. These early lessons of work ethic and humility have stayed with me. I didn‚Äôt realize it then, but I was learning life‚Äîone task, one mistake, one improvement at a time.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Card 4 -->
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Challenges That Built Me</h2>
    <p>Like any journey, mine had rough paths. I struggled with confidence and fitting in. Sometimes it felt like others had more ‚Äî more resources, more chances. But I refused to let comparisons define me. I focused on effort and became stronger with every setback I overcame.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Card 5 -->
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Growth and Gratitude</h2>
    <p>By the time I reached my teen years, I had grown emotionally and intellectually. I was leading study groups, winning school contests, and helping others who struggled like I once did. My family‚Äôs belief in me became my inner voice. I understood what it meant to rise steadily, humbly, and with purpose.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Card 6 -->
  <div class="card">
    <h2>The Foundation of Who I Am</h2>
    <p>Every moment from my childhood‚Äîgood or challenging‚Äîshaped me. It gave me a backbone of resilience, a heart of empathy, and a mind that refuses to settle. I didn‚Äôt just survive my childhood. I built from it. And today, I walk with pride, knowing the roots of who I am were grounded in love, discipline, and growth.</p>
